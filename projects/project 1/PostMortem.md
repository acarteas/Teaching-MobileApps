**struggles I overcame: Ther hurlde to understanding C# and android XML. moving from c++ style of compiler language into C#'s object oriented programming. Having a reliable place to debug and run my code.

**The best part about the assignment was being thrown into something completley new and having to gather your own resources and knowledge to complete he assignment.

**I enjoyed the option to create anything that we wanted to. it didnt have to be a calculator, but thats where most of us went for our first steps

** The most difficult part to understand was the new language itself. Sure it's similar to c++ but it's got its definitive differences. 

**dealing with eye irritation and light sensitive has also made this very challenging.
