Postfix Calculator
This application was written for my first assignment in CS 480 Mobile Applications. It is a basic postfix calculator. It computes whole numbers and can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

System Design
This app does basic calculations using postfix notation. For instance, you can input 3 23 4 + - and you will get the answer 22.

Usage
Numbers can be input directly into the text box using the Android keyboard or can be pressed using the interface buttons.
