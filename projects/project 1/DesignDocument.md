# APPLICATION NAME
I created a basic calculator for my first app, and really had to get use to the different tools and how everthing works on visual studio. My app has a working screen that will be able to take different numbers and make them execute depending on the operation given. Had a hard time getting mine to run but have everything I could see needed to make this application work. Tried doing the program in multiple ways so really refreshed on some old coding.  

## System Design 
Tried to implement the vibrate function but had to get rid of this. Apps types and clears correctly but not the best at outputting at times. 

## Usage
You use this application by clicking corresponding numbers and operations to the calculator and allowing it to compute these numbers.
