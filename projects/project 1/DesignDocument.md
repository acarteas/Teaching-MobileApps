# APPLICATION NAME

I created a postfix calculator. This calculator displays the input like an infix calculator, but does calculations as a postfix calculator. There are buttons for numbers, operations, entry clears, and entries. This program uses stacks to track it's data.
==========================================================================================================================================
I wrote this program to take the first steps into mobile application development. Being able to actually interact with something you've created is amazing. I want to be able to take create something that I can use for myself and for the sake of others. 
==========================================================================================================================================
So far, this calculator serves the purpose of meeting the homework requirements. However, it's purpose was much more than that, because of all of the skills I've gained from it. It's purpose is to start the plunge into mobile development. 


## System Design 
System Requirements: 
Must have an adroid device that uses Android 7.0 - API Level 24. The device must have available RAM of 700. 
Must have android Nouget and above. 


## Usage
To use this application the Users will have to input their equation one piece at a time. In the process of: "1, then enter, +, then enter, 2, then enter." Which will display "1 + 2". Hitting enter twice in a row will give the result of the equation. The "C" button will clear the text within both TextViews and will clear all of the stacks. The "CE" button will only clear what is in the first TextView.
