# Project #1: Make Something!
This assignment is intended to offer an incentive to begin learning the basics of Android app development and the development tools and environments that you will use throughout the semester.  As such, you'll have a faster turnaround time than the other assignments.  

## Application Requirements
For this assignment, you must build a moderately simple single-page application.  I expect this application to be in the realm of complexity of a basic postfix calculator â€“ one or more buttons that are tied to some sort of interaction with one or more application views.  Remember, the specifics are up to you.  However, if you can't think of anything that fits the bill, feel free to make a postfix calculator.

## Deliverables
This first assignment is due on Monday, January 29, 2018 by midnight.  By the due date, you must submit the following:
* Your complete source tree, placed in the "source" directory
* A compiled binary (*.APK file), placed in the "binaries" directory
* [A completed Design Document](./DesignDocument.md)
* [A completed Post Mortem](./PostMortem.md) (due one day later; January 30)

## Grading
Your project will be graded using the following criteria:

### Application Complexity
* Does the application complexity match that of a basic postfix calculator?  
* Note than an **A** project will go above and beyond the base complexity requirement

### Application Completeness
* Is your application complete?
* Does your application compile?

### Binaries
* Will the supplied APK install and run on an Android 7+ device?

### Source Code Checkins
* Did you use github to regularly check in changes to code?
* Does the checkin history demonstrate consisten progress on the assignment or did you throw everything together in one huge checkin at the last minute?
* Note that an **A** project will demonstrate regular development throughout the project window

### Design Document
* Does the design document clearly articulate the purpose and scope of your project?
* Did you create sufficient scenarios and use cases that give a sufficient description of the project?
* Did you provide system requirements?
* Did you provide a usage manual?

### Post Mortem
* Does your post mortem demostrate metacognitive skills?
