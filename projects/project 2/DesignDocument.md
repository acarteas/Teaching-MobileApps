# APPLICATION NAME
  My application was designed to add effects to captured images. It includes these image effects: Remove Red, Remove Blue, remove Green, Negate Red, Negate Blue, Negate Green, Grey Scale, Add Noise, and High Contrast. I expect this program to be used for good, and good alone. I wrote it as the beginnings of a larger image manipulation program. Hopefully I can evolve it into something powerful enough to fix my friends selfies.

After accepting your image, you'll be in the editor where you can check the image effects you would like to apply.
