# Image Manipulator
This application was written to satisfy the requirements of my CS 480 Mobile Applications class and to practice my skills with C# and Xamarin.

## System Design
This application was written for Android 5.1+ phones. The application runs in a vertical orientation. 

## Usage
This application will prompt you to either take a picture or load from gallery. On the next screen your image will be loaded and ready to manipulate. You can scroll through several manipulations:

-No effect
-Remove red, green, blue
-Negate red, green blue
-Grayscale
-High contrast
-Add noise

After choosing manipulations press "Apply" to apply the manipulation and save it to your phone.
