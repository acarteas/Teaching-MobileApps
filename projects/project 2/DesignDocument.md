# APPLICATION NAME
  My application was designed to add effects to captured images. 
  **It includes these image effects: Remove Red, Remove Blue, remove Green, Negate Red, Negate Blue, Negate Green, Grey Scale, Add Noise,                                      and High Contrast. 
 
I wrote it as the beginnings of a larger image manipulation program. Hopefully I can evolve it into something powerful enough to help my friends' photos. 

## System Design 
System Requirments:
  -Android 7.1 (Nougat)
  -x86
Uses:
  -Can be used to add image effects to pictures captured within the app. 
Scenario:
  -If you would like to see what the world would look like with different colors, then you can use this app to test it out!

## Usage
  To use this application, you will:
**1st: First click the "Open Camera" button. This will open the default camera app, where you can take a photo of your choosing. You will        be prompted to with a selection screen. 
**2nd: Clicking the check mark will take you to the editor, while pressing the "X" will allow you to retake the photo. 
**3rd: After accepting your image, you'll be in the editor where you can choose the image effects you would like to apply. You can check          as many as you would like.
       !!However unchecking one will uncheck all of them. 
 
NOTE: 4th step does not execute properly. You can only view the changes done on your current image. Saving does not work.  
**4th: (When you are finished, click the done button to return to the main page and you can find your image saved within the phones                gallery.)
