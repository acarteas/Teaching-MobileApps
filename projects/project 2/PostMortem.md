# Post Mortem

## Overall
Most of my code was implemented while following documentation, then lots of trial and error. The documentation is tough to understand and doesn’t include any examples. I also can’t usually find any other tutorials to break down concepts for me like I could with other programming assignments. So I think I became a lot more comfortable with programming for android, but have a long way to go to do really well.

I learned about intents and moving data from one screen to another. I also learned about Bitmaps and how to manipulate them. I don’t think I would want to do an assignment that deals with the camera or gallery again, there doesn’t seem to be a not buggy way to do this that works on most devices.

I also learned more about designing layouts. Using the ImageButton was a cool effect.
I had more trouble with Github, and tried to turn in the assignment a few minutes before midnight. There was some merge conflicts that had to be worked out for some reason, so my assignment was pushed three minutes late.

## Unresolved issues
The .apk I submitted would not even install on my phone for some reason. I will have to figure it out and rebuild it, but I don’t know if that would count as turning it in late. Will find out during class.

I wasn’t able to implement all of the image manipulations. I just ran out of time.

Loading from gallery works on the emulator but not on phones. I tried with a Galaxy Note 4 and Note 8.
Loading from camera stopped working on the emulator and only works on phones. No changes were made to any files or Visual Studio when this happened, so I am baffled.

## Issues I had while working on this programming assignment
Finding information was very hard. When learning C++ or data structures I could find tutorials or videos on the internet to learn. There seems to be very little of that when dealing with android programming, and especially when using Xamarin. What I do find is often outdated or just bad information. The documentation itself is hard to read and understand, and it offers no examples. This was my biggest issue.

Xamarin and the Android Studio components, like the emulator, are also very buggy. I had the designer crash often and I would lose my xml file. The Android emulator had constant issues and seems very buggy too. Using the lab computers were much worse than my home pcs, there was constant problems and I rarely got work done at school in lab.

An emulator would “bug out” and stop working correctly. I would think it was my code, but creating a new copy of the emulator would make my code work. Emulators also became super zoomed in, and there was no fixing it besides making a new emulator. I must have tripped some setting but I don’t know where.

My next project will be in Android Studio for sure, in hopes that fixes some of these problems.

## Provide any suggestions for improving the assignment in the future
I think this is a great assignment and in the end you have an app that does real stuff a real app does. That’s awesome. It was just a bummer not getting to finish. I don’t know that even another week would have been enough. But that would be a very slow class spending weeks on an app like this, so I understand it is probably best to do it this way. After the semester is over I’d like to spend time finishing up all my projects and adding polish to them.
