Post Mortem

I enjoyed this project quite a bit, though I wish I could have done more on it. Initially I planned to implement decimals, negative numbers, copy/paste, square roots and exponents. However I am glad to have something done in time. One bug I didn’t have time to fix is when there is two spaces in the edittext box it does not compute properly. I was out of time to fix that.

Github has been a real pain and I still am not sure of what I am doing. I hope everything is done correctly there. Figuring out their system is harder than programming. 

In the next project I’d like to do things more efficiently. I laid out the buttons and listeners in a very basic way just to get it done in the limited time frame.

This first project has been a fun learning experience. I am looking forward to the next one.
